acting as child sex traffickers Trump will stop them Trump I wish my friend an accused child sex trafficker well Lets call it what it is The Trump Virus Trump was asked about Ghislane Maxwell and wished her well then I guess they lived in Palm Beach I dont know That's irrelevant information to distance himself from child molesters and is unrelated to the question he was asked It's how someone who's bad at lying lies There are people who truly believe Trump is intelligent Those words will never cease to confound me Over million Americans chose Donald J Trump to run their country This is the country he's given them one that abuses and assaults its own citizens and denies them of their constitutional first amendment rights MeidasTouch st New Q drop explaining that when Trump said he wishes

identifying that the FBI had seen NO EVIDENCE of any individuals affiliated with The Trump Team in contact with Russian Intelligence Officers MEDIA SILENT IT'S TIME FOR CHARGES WHO AGREES The amount

such anecdotes have yet to surface wor Imagine the outrage if Barack Obama had wished an accused rapist well Thats exactly what Trump just did when he was asked about Ghislane Maxwell Why are Republicans completely silent TrumpPresser Trump's coronavirus briefing was completely useless Who cares if he shifts tone if he doesn't shift policy Where is the testing and contact tracing Where is the plan to safely open schools Where is the national strategy Trumps press conference today on coronavirus was masterful By the end the normally hostile journalists credited him for a change in tone He was in command of the facts realistic about the present determined about the future And theres no way JoeBiden couldve done it What if what if Trump asked all his supporters to wear red masks to show their support visibly It is also plausibly deniable for any one person BOOM That would fook up a few minds no Betcha masks would be done and finished pretty quick Trump seemed sincere when wishing the child rapist enabler well Not so much when honoring civil rights icon John Lewis Hillary Clinton got a contribution from Harvey Weinstein and CillizzaCNN et al had a clock counting down the minutes until she denounced him Trump just acknowledged that a woman who trafficked in little girls was a social acquaintance of his and he WISHED HER WELL Pelosi says on CNNSitRoom that its the Trump virus saying more people would have followed his lead and thousands fewer would have died if he took more serious actions such as embracing mask wearing earlier and listening to science Seems to me that a Trump pardon of Ghislaine Maxwell would constitute a de facto confession that yes the rumors about him raping the underage girl s at his buddy Jeffrey Epstein's place are true LincolnsBible Simple Question If Trump's gestapo-like troops are in Portland to protect Federal property why are they driving around in vans and abducting US Citizens off the streets All snark aside todays presser showed how futile the WHs efforts to rehab Trumps polling truly are Even when they can get him to monotone through prepared remarks he goes off script and does something dumb like wish Ghislaine Maxwell well Its hopeless This is so tiring but We dont need a new tone We need a new strategy Wed be able to mostly contain the virus with a universal mask mandate and daily testing Trump still refuses to do either of those things Thats the news SpeakerPelosi just called COVID the Trump Virus on CNN So a trump campaign Volunteer murdered the son of a federal judge Im still thinking about Trump wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well Trump just said of Ghislaine Maxwell who is under arrest for sex trafficking of minors I wish her well What type of statement is that No sympathy for the victims of Maxwell and his friend Jeffrey Epstein Today might not have been Trumps worst day or his cruelest day or his most shameful day But today was the day Trump issued an orderabout the censusdespite clear words to the contrary in the Constitution a Supreme Court opinion Thats a really really dangerous day President Trump said he wishes Ghislaine Maxwell well as she faces charges for recruiting

documenta partially redacted and clearly incomplete summary of the August counterintelligence briefing Trump received alongside Mike Flynn and Chris Christie What's not in the document is as revealing as what is f id Trump his team have repeatedly belittled COVID risks but more than are dead we can't pretend long-term risks like heart damage strokes dont exist We want to know what the administration is doing about COVIDs chronic health impacts hea Trump insisted to NC that they had to let him have a full convention Mocked leaders who favored masks and made clear he frowned on slower reopenings That caught up to him us Trump is talking about taking down the ugly FBI building in DC which is an absolute eyesore Replying to SethAbramson At the June meeting the top three men in Trump's campaign met with a self-described Kremlin agent in Trump's home Trump Tower to discuss a Trump's policy plans and b the removal of sanctions on Russia Documents were exchanged that sought to aid Trump's campaign Replying to SethAbramson Trump's Letter of Intent to do with Agalarov the biggest deal of his lifeTrump Tower Moscowwas active per Agalarov through early ending only with Trump's inauguration Trump regularly shared policy plans with Agalarov and Agalarov told him they pleased the Kremlin Replying to SethAbramson Every public statement Trump has made about his negotiations with Moscow businessmen and every public statement Trump has made about his negotiations with Moscow businessmen have been lies In three years of research I found no honest recitation of events by Trump Replying to SethAbramson Trump knew before his August briefing that his agentson his orderswere reaching out to parties in Moscow to see if they could acquire the stolen docs illegally of course Trump was daily lying about his past contacts with Kremlin agents and what he'd said to them Replying to SethAbramson So as primary voting in the election began both Trump and Flynn were working on business deals that required and benefited from Trump having a very specific national security policy with respect to Russia thatcriticallyhe and Flynn had communicated to Russian agents Replying to SethAbramson Understand the context in which Trump received the briefing In late he'd been in regular contact with Putin's builderAras Agalarovand regularly discussed his policy views at a time the Kremlin knew he'd be running for POTUS Trump then went into business with Agalarov Replying to SethAbramson ITEM FBI The FBI told Trump that it had a number of active cases of Russian IOs working in the US to conduct precisely the sort of work within the campaign Trump and Flynn knew Kislyak Agalarov and Papadopoulos' Russian MFA contacts were pursuing He said nothing Trump said he was done with any sport where players kneel He also said he was going to throw out the first pitch at a Yankees game in August Your move Babyfingers MLBONFOX statu The country is in very good shape other than if you look South and West President Donald J Trump Im sorry but Donald Trump sounds like a stalker fan when it comes to Obama Replying to SethAbramson Throughout this period Trump and members of his family were in contact with Kremlin agent Agalarov who kept telling Trump that his policy plans were being met with great approval by power brokers in Moscow Trump knewand Flynn knewthis was good for their respective deals Replying to SethAbramson With that in mind here's what the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Counterintelligence Division communicated to Trump in his August briefingwhich he attended with Mike Flynn his top NatSec adviser despite Trump studiously never formally naming him to his NatSec team Replying to SethAbramson From April to June Trump's NatSec team met repeatedly with Putin intelligence agent Kislyak to share details about Trump's policy plans Every single meeting was covered up and then lied about even in subsequent testimony to Congress And then the June meeting happened Replying to SethAbramson Beginning in mid Michael Flynnalso at the August briefingentered into a secret deal to work with Russia Saudi Arabia UAE Egypt and Israel The deal would see Trump carrying through on his plan to end Russia sanctions Flynn was then Trump's top NatSec adviser Replying to SethAbramson As part of Trump discussing his policy plans in Moscow he met with many Kremlin agents he knew to be Kremlin agents such as Putin's banker his building permits man and his builder Trump wouldn't shut up about his policy views He'd decided to run for POTUS a year earlier Replying to SethAbramson ITEM FBI The FBI told Trump and Flynn that if NOCs were contacting the Trump campaign the FBI would need some forehand knowledge from the campaign or other intel sources regarding who or what to look for Trump and Flynn stayed deadly quiet here adding nothing We now have confirmation Barack Obamas FBI spied on candidate Donald J Trump Not just associates Trump himself The biggest scandal in American history and Trump is the VICTIM So Trump just cancelled the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville Florida because the coronavirus pandemic is too dangerous for a bunch of rich old white dude politicians but his administration is on track to let the COVID Public Health Emergency expire in two days This President has been practically the biggest failure in

to see Trump finally taking on the Covid pandemic At his briefing he brought in the great epidemiologist Mariano Rivera More documents released today confirming Barack Obama spied on the Trump campaign Still ZERO indictments Replying to SethAbramson In March Papadopoulos told Trump that hePapadopouloswas in touch with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs which wanted a secret backchannel to the campaign Trumplike Papadopoulos' fellow NatSec adviser Flynnwas pursuing deals in Moscow and let his aide proceed Replying to SethAbramson In now-candidate Trump entered into negotiationsthrough Michael Cohen whose tell-all book Trump is now trying to block through DOJ actions just ruled illegalwith another Moscow businessman Once again he was told his policy plans were part of what made him attractive Mark Meadows calls the decision to call off an in-person convention one of the most difficult decisions that any President or politician might have to make Biden made this decision weeks ago Trump insisted on moving the convention to another city before deciding to scrap it JDiamond1 stat The presumption of regularity rests on the prosaic notion that the government

but should be executed That's how dangerous Trump is Don't ever forget it Not for a second This will be at least the third Trump-loving media personality Trump has talked to today Someone is feeling desperate to be loved realDonaldTrum Replying to realDonaldTrump Im hearing from people all over the country that the Kamala Harris pick just turned Biden supporters into Trump voters Shes too far left Replying to SethAbramson I think we have a tendency to feel so exhausted by Trump's words that we treat them as meaningful when they're meaningless and meaningless when they're meaningful The President of the United States has accused his opponent of treasonand that is profoundly vile and dangerous Trump reacted to the news that Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate by melting down and spewing nonsense about treason and Pocahontas tru via politicususa Replying to SethAbramson I'm glad Daniel Dale is fact-checking Trump on this And yet isn't this the sort of historically vile statement by a president that must be more than fact-checked Shouldn't every GOP pol in America be asked to immediately denounce Trump's sick slur ddale8 status Trump Ivanka and Mnuchin have all

a bloody dictatorship which has been lasting for years Americans bUt iN aMeRiCawe got tRuMp People quoting with Delete are the exact reason why morons like Trump get elected if americans want more progressive ideas they need to keep supporting the party that leans more towards that objective We all can agree that BidenXHarris might not be the best combination BUT taylorswift13 maybe unpopular opinion but a celebrity publicly supporting biden harris doesnt necessarily mean theyre that moderate conservative nor do they agree with all of their stances but rather they want to rally their fans primarily young people to turn out and vote out trump Replying to realDonaldTrump But if you only knew the things Ive had to endure over the last years under the Trump Administration So excuse me if Im not as diplomatic about realDonaldTrump as Ive been with the others See if you can SURVIVE what Ive been through maintain your objectivity Re-watch Harris tying Barr in knots and its pretty clear why Biden would be eager to enlist her against Trump and Pence VP debate Oct opinions framing their attack on Harris as phony betrays how small a target she offers the Trump campaign Considering all of the civil unrest and rioting taking place all across the United States its pretty obvious that Obama and his allies have continued their goal of trying to fundamentally transform this nation This Election is so relevant Trump no-communist-r Replying to SethAbramson And instead of all of America grinding to a haltwith a refusal to move forward until Trump retracts his false claimmedia imagine that if they ignore it it didn't happen But hundreds of thousands saw it liveand millions will hear it spoken of approvingly on far-right media Replying to ProjectLincoln Her tweets in defense of Trump havent had a kernel of truth She brought the bad popcorn karma on herself Tea Pain aint been this excited in years We have the perfect ticket to take down Trump in November The best part Trump knows it Replying to SethAbramson Trump didn't just name Obama and Biden as part of a group that committedas he falsely claims treason he said it was the highest treason which is code I don't know why I call it code it's actually explicit for this is the sort of treason you get the death penalty for I truly DO NOT CARE what your reason is for not liking Kamala or Biden Your hot takes don't matter

in office for over four decades and weve seen Trump nonstop for the last four years Weve seen enough to make up our minds about them So lets skip the presidential debates but have three vice-presidential debates Every time realDonaldTrump speaks about women who oppose him he calls them nasty which is doubly noteworthy because who on earth is nastier on a regular basis than Trump I cant wait for the Hardly knew him Its my favorite Trump behavior reedgalen stat The amazing thing isn't that Trump donated to KamalaHarris previous campaigns It's that the checks cleared Replying to Yair_Rosenberg Remember Trump actually made some of his anti-Semitic statements in front of the Republican Jewish Coalition who now claim Kamala doesn't stand with Jews Youre not going to support me because I dont want your money Thats okay you want to control your own politician Yair_Rosenberg NEW Trump world has yet to settle on its indictment of Kamala Harris Is she too pro-cop or anti-cop A leftist or a phony moderate pretending Dangerously radical or too inept to be effective The president also faults her for being nasty to Biden politics BREAKING Citing To Kill a Mockingbird a federal

jokes aside we have to beat Trump And I cannot think of anyone more capable of doing that without remotely threatening the establishment that created him in the first place than Biden Harris Now lets go out there and get back to the slightly less apocalyptic normal Trump has begun his trolling of Kamala Its all over for him Its also a tribute to whet a crappy campaign team Trump has assembled and run that he came out today sounding like he already lost and having nothing of any substance other than racism and sexism Trump campaign is making Biden into the babyface and Harris into a heel This will prove highly effective in the electorate in ways the opposition has yet to even realize The idea of introducing at the eleventh hour a system in which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief my comments tonight on behalf of ASCL_UK BBCNews news education Has Trump ever called a white male nasty or does he reserve that term for black women Hey Trump Trolls Your boy is going

committed countless crimes including obstruction of justice fleecing students at his fraudulent university and misusing funds in his fraudulent foundation He should be in prison for good Trump The biggest problem with election fraud isn't Russia China or Iran it's the Democrats Donald Trump is proposing to raid the social security trust fund and I know everyone is busy and stoked about Kamala

evidence for this he keeps emphasizing the supposed anger of this Black woman Its so so dangerous to carry these Trump press events live because there are just so many lies and so much misinformation im totally convinced that the single biggest messaging problem for the trump campaign is that the presidents brain is irrevocably scrambled from watching too much fox news and being too online It is clear from the last hours that the Trump campaign has no strategy for dealing with the BidenHarris momentum Maybe Trump is hoping they will just disappear like a miracle Trump There will be tremendous growth next year just like Mexico paid for the wall just like he had a better health care plan to replace Obamacare just like he was going to hand over his taxes after he became President Sometimes I just listen to Trump talk and think how can anybody co-sign this He talking in circles and jus freestyling now Second day in a row that Trump given multiple chances to define Harris has fixated mainly on his own disbelief that Biden would pick someone as his running mate who had criticized him Asked how he would pay for Social Security by eliminating the payroll tax given the massive debt Trump says We are going to have tremendous growth Per washingtonpost reporting Trump refused to sign the CARES Act if it included a bailout for the USPS We told them very clearly that the president was not

get into the general fund Trump says Tremendous growth President Trump reacting to Kamala Harris attacking him for his coronavirus response She is very bad on fact She is very weak on facts Note One of the chief criticisms of President Trump from critics is that he almost daily says misleading things does not present facts Trump didn't put on a year prison sentence for knocking down statues That is a maximum discretionary sentence in old laws on damage to federal property and to monuments of US veterans Trump's executive order just said people should be fully prosecuted under existing laws Trump was asked near the end of the news conference about why US deaths are still rising even though they aren't elsewhere Trump's answer What's going up are cases If you look at cases the cases are going up because we do so much testing and we find it No This is obscene And Fox News should demand she issue an apology This is more of the game Trump played in as to Second Amendment people and

ago This president is fomenting deadly violence to please his base Why does Trump defend a murderer Because hes smart enough not to attack his base NEW from JoeBiden I urge the President to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is a olence is wrong period No matter who does Donald Trump can't say that then he is unfit to be President his preference for more violence not less is clear AMwTy37bGd So Trump just straight up lied about Jacob Blakes family Im shocked There is no moral equivalence Biden is willing to denounce violence because he really is against violence Trump wont denounce his supporters violence because he isnt really against it 6K4ZJJGJkN August The day Trump went on live television and defended an alleged murderer who supports him atrupar status This speech was given before Trump's press conference and all the president did there was confirm every charge made against him JoeBiden statu Funny I just talked to Mpolymer a retired CIA counter-terrorism officer about this and he said these Trump caravans reminded him of what he saw all over the Middle East including those early ISIS pick up truck parades with flags and guns EliStokols sta Important to note that Trump did not say he supports vigilantism I would prefer if everything were taken care of by law enforcement I see Trump had another press conference today where he actively incited violence against Black people and we're all incapable of accurately covering a President who wants to conduct ethnic cleansing to secure an election Trump wont say it Too weak to stand up to the radical right Needs their votes kylegriffin1 s Last month Biden was attacking Trump for sending feds to Portland Now he says hes always been against the violence in Portland He is full of it and I have the receipts Biden tonight on Trump presser Tonight the President declined to rebuke violence He wouldn't even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder because of his attacks on others He is too weak too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it Trump spent the weekend frenetically tweeting and today at his press conference appeared shaken Feels like the reality of prison is starting to set in If the riots are really Trumps fault do you think Democrats and the media wouldve spent the last three months calling them peaceful protests Trump on not meeting Jacob Blakes family in Kenosha tomorrow They wanted to have lawyers involved and I thought that was inappropriate so I didnt do that But I did speak with the pastor of the family Blakes father just now on CNNSitRoom We don't have a family pastor Trump is the first law and order candidate to praise a double murderer The last time voters elected a Republican mayor Seattle Minneapolis Portland Chicago Washington D C NEVER But Democrats want to blame President Trump for crime in these cities Nearly Americans have died from coronavirus More than million out of work Students across the country cant go back to campus More than small businesses closed for good This is Trumps America Cant believe this needs to be said but since Trump is defending Rittenhouse saying the video we all saw where he killed one man and wounded another was self defense So again Rittenhouse had already shot someone in the head murdering them Thats why he was being chased Four years ago Trump promised this We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation None of that happened Zip Nada Judge leaders by their deeds not their words trump is currently defending rolling to a blm protest with paintball guns and mace and spraying people as long as it's a conservative doing it I urge the President to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is a right a necessity violence is wrong period No matter who does Donald Trump can't say that then he is unfit to be President and his preference for more violence not less is clear tTZhyvqdfd When neo-Nazis marched on Charlottesville killing a peaceful protester Trump said there were very fine people on both sides Now one of his supporters murdered two protesters and he insinuates it was self-defense Trump fuels condones and enables this kind of violence Yamiche status White women If you think Donald Trumps armed supporters will protect you and your family from crime a reminder that theyre not just racist and bigoted theyre misogynists too As MsPackyetti said Your whiteness will not save you from what patriarchy has for you Biden Anyone who engages in violence or destruction from all sides should be prosecuted and held responsible for their actions Trump Well he may have been charged with murdering two people But I hear he's a fan of mine Trump is weak radical and corrupt BidenCalm Trump in I could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and get away with it Trump in and so can you JoeBiden statement on Trump's press conference Tonight the President declined to rebuke violence He is too weak too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it It's time to face the facts Donald Trump is a fascist Use the word Biden is using mafia talking points Trump says without any hint of irony Wake me up when he accuses Biden for cheating on Melania There is an America worth fighting for Donald Trump will never do it because he doesn't even know what it is Trump accused Biden of using mafia talking points Trump referred to federal witnesses as rats Fresh off of publicly and proudly defending an accused child sexual trafficker Trump is now publicly and proudly defending an accused murderer Ive never seen anything like this from a Western political leader in my lifetime atrupar status It will be up to other leaders of the intelligence community as well as members of Congress to push back aggressively against the authoritarian whims of Trump The oath they swore to the Constitution of the United States demands it opinions Trump defended paintball-shooting supporters Trump refused to condemn Kyle Rittenhouse It doesn't seem like those on the right who want Joe Biden to make specific statements on violence should have those opinions amplified anymore So Trumps whole thing is Biden wont condemn violence but Trump wont condemn a murderer Shame on every jackass who carried water for this asshole Replying to joelockhart realDonaldTrump Yes Trump's mild right-sided circumduction gait coupled with his diminished right-hand grip strength is highly suggestive of a moderate CVA stroke Moreover Trump has very likely had multiple small strokes contributing

briefing as the one prepared for President Trump But so far this hasn't happened and it's not clear when they will begin according to intelligence officials czxkn14 The Constitutional process has not been violated Pres Trump is within his rights to pursue legal challenges to the outcome of the election The media are creating a false narrative to push the idea that Biden has won he hasn't and that Trump is obstructing justice he isn't The wealthy trump donors are passing on his current fundraisers opting instead to use their money in GA senate race That means that trump is literally bilking the

saying there was fraud No joke If theyre saying those elections had illegal votes why would we seat them Until Trump concedes do not sanction those elections The real danger of this ridiculous game
